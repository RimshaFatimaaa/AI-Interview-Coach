# AI Interview Coach - Technical Guide

## üéØ **Overview**
AI-powered interview practice application using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for question generation and answer evaluation, with NLP preprocessing and semantic similarity matching.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Core Components**
- **Primary LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (question generation + answer evaluation)
- **NLP Processing**: spaCy + NLTK (text preprocessing, NER, sentiment analysis)
- **Similarity Matching**: sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web interface
- **Authentication**: Supabase
- **Fallback**: DialoGPT-Medium + FLAN-T5 (when OpenAI unavailable)

### **Key Files**
- `app.py` - Main Streamlit application
- `notebooks/LLMs_test.py` - Core evaluation logic + canonical answers
- `ai_modules/langchain_processor.py` - LangChain integration (bypassed)
- `ai_modules/llm_processor_simple.py` - Simple LLM processor (fallback)

## üìä **Data Storage**

### **Reference Data (Permanent)**
- **Location**: `notebooks/LLMs_test.py` ‚Üí `CANONICAL_QA` variable
- **Content**: Reference answers for similarity matching
- **Examples**: `hr_01`, `tech_01`, etc.

### **Session Data (Temporary)**
- **Location**: Streamlit `st.session_state`
- **Content**: Current question, conversation history, evaluation results
- **Persistence**: Memory only, lost on app restart

### **No Permanent Storage**
- ‚ùå Interview questions/answers are NOT saved to files
- ‚ùå No database storage for interview data
- ‚úÖ Only reference answers are persistent

## üîÑ **Evaluation Process**

### **Current Flow**
1. **Question Generation**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini generates questions
2. **Answer Processing**: NLP pipeline preprocesses user input
3. **Similarity Matching**: sentence-transformers find best canonical match
4. **OpenAI Evaluation**: GPT-4o-mini evaluates against canonical reference
5. **Score Calculation**: Relevance, completeness, clarity (0-100 each)
6. **Feedback Generation**: Detailed feedback and suggestions

### **Scoring System**
- **Overall Score**: Average of relevance + completeness + clarity
- **Relevance**: How well answer addresses the question
- **Completeness**: How comprehensive the answer is
- **Clarity**: How clear and well-structured the answer is

---

## üìà **Scoring Rules**

### **Relevance (0-100)**
- **Topic Keywords**: Teamwork, leadership, technical, communication terms
- **Vague Language Penalty**: "I guess", "I think", "maybe", "stuff" (-8 points each)
- **Keyword Overlap**: 8+ terms = 85-95 points, 0 terms = 25-45 points

### **Clarity (0-100)**
- **Length Analysis**: 100+ words = 60 points, 1-4 words = 10 points
- **Filler Word Penalty**: "um", "uh", "like" (-5 points each, max 20)
- **Sentence Structure**: 15+ words/sentence = 25 points
- **Vocabulary Diversity**: 70%+ unique words = 15 points bonus

### **Correctness (0-100)**
- **Canonical Comparison**: 60%+ overlap = 95 points
- **Quality Indicators**: "experience", "project", "team" (+25 points for 5+ indicators)
- **Vague Language**: 3+ vague indicators = 10 points (very low)

## üß™ **Test Cases**

### **Excellent Answer** (90-95/100)
```
"In my previous role as a Senior Developer at TechCorp, I led a cross-functional team of 5 people to deliver a critical e-commerce platform migration. I organized daily standups, created a detailed project timeline, and ensured clear communication between frontend, backend, and DevOps teams. When we encountered a major integration issue, I facilitated a problem-solving session where each team member contributed their expertise. We successfully delivered the project 2 weeks ahead of schedule while maintaining 99.9% uptime."
```
- **Word Count**: 58 words
- **Filler Words**: 0
- **Vague Language**: 0
- **Expected Scores**: Relevance 90-95, Clarity 90-95, Correctness 85-90

### **Poor Answer** (30-40/100)
```
"I guess I'm okay at programming. I know some stuff about JavaScript and React."
```
- **Word Count**: 12 words
- **Filler Words**: 0
- **Vague Language**: 3 ("I guess", "some stuff")
- **Expected Scores**: Relevance 40-50, Clarity 25-35, Correctness 30-40

### **Very Bad Answer** (3-15/100)
```
"a"
```
- **Word Count**: 1 word
- **Expected Scores**: All scores very low due to length and content
