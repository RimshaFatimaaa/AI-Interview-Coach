## 2. Question Generation System

### 2.1 Question Types
- **Given** a user selects "hr_behavioral" question type
- **When** they click "Generate Question"
- **Then** the system should generate a behavioral interview question
- **And** the question should be relevant to teamwork, leadership, communication, or problem-solving

- **Given** a user selects "technical" question type
- **When** they click "Generate Question"
- **Then** the system should generate a technical interview question
- **And** the question should be relevant to programming, problem-solving, or technical skills

### 2.2 Difficulty Levels
- **Given** a user selects "easy" difficulty
- **When** a question is generated
- **Then** the question should be straightforward and basic

- **Given** a user selects "medium" difficulty
- **When** a question is generated
- **Then** the question should require moderate technical knowledge or experience

- **Given** a user selects "hard" difficulty
- **When** a question is generated
- **Then** the question should be complex and require advanced knowledge

## 3. Answer Evaluation System (NLP + LLM Hybrid)

### 3.1 NLP Preprocessing
- **Given** a user submits an answer
- **When** the system processes the response
- **Then** it should perform the following NLP preprocessing:
  - Convert text to lowercase
  - Remove stop words
  - Remove punctuation
  - Remove filler words (um, uh, like, etc.)
  - Tokenize and lemmatize words
  - Extract named entities
  - Perform sentiment analysis

### 3.2 LLM Evaluation
- **Given** a preprocessed answer
- **When** the LLM evaluates the response
- **Then** it should provide scores for:
  - **Relevance Score** (0-100): How well the answer addresses the question
  - **Clarity Score** (0-100): How clear and well-structured the answer is
  - **Correctness Score** (0-100): Technical accuracy and correctness
  - **Overall Score** (0-100): Weighted combination of all scores

### 3.3 Feedback Generation
- **Given** an evaluated answer
- **When** the system generates feedback
- **Then** it should provide:
  - Detailed written feedback explaining the scores
  - Specific suggestions for improvement
  - Areas of strength and weakness

**Expected Output:**
- Overall Score: 15-30/100
- Relevance: 20-40/100
- Clarity: 10-25/100
- Correctness: 15-35/100

- Suggestions: Detailed guidance on providing specific examples

## 6. Performance Requirements

### 6.1 Response Time
- **Given** a user submits an answer for evaluation
- **When** the system processes the response
- **Then** the evaluation should complete within 10-15 seconds
- **And** the user should see a loading spinner during processing

### 6.2 Model Loading
- **Given** the application starts
- **When** models are initialized
- **Then** both NLP and LLM models should load successfully
